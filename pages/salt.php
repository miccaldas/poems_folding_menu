          <p>I’m becoming the pillar of salt.<br>
          The last glance to Gomorrah.</p>
          <p>Orpheus guilty glimpse over the shoulder,<br>
          the last long look to things not done,<br>
          to the Styx and<br>
          forward.<br>
          Forward…<br>
          to the sadness of wrong turns taken at the wrong times.</p>
          <p>Opportunities lost as soon as they are found,<br>
          time passing by like a thief in the night…</p>
          <p>watching the spectacle of being and<br>
          living as the silent detached witness of myself.</p>
          <p>Cold<br>
          distant<br>
          and aloof.</p>
          <p>I haven’t slept for five years.</p>
          <p>All,</p>
          <p>All days<br>
          mornings afternoons and nights,</p>
          <p>all,<br>
          together,<br>
          one after the other.<br>
          All days and all nights,<br>
          are the same, under the harsh insomniac light.</p>
          <p>The hours pass<br>
          (dirge-like as in a prison)<br>
          as I walk down the garden locked inside the walls of my house.</p>
          <p>The light darts yellow trough the window and onto the trees,<br>
          as if shielding them from reality…</p>
          <p>Yellow restless light that counts time passed between vigil and feverish dreams.<br>
          A light of ruse and mischief,<br>
          artistry and puppetry,<br>
          light made by a slight of hands, smoke and mirrors.<br>
          reminding me that,<br>
          from now on,<br>
          there is nothing here but the ghosts of reason.</p>
          <p>In the phantasmal light that scars the trees,<br>
          I sit grass like and canopy looking…<br>
          tall and distant….<br>
          Taut and alert.</p>
          <p>trees.</p>
          <p>I watch them green and stupid,<br>
          tended and erect,<br>
          darting upwards towards the sky…</p>
          <p>silently intent on photosynthesis.</p>
          <p>Inside them a myriad of organisms, moved by the simplest tropisms.<br>
          grow and move,<br>
          restlessly and mercilessly,<br>
          unmoving and uncaring.<br>
          oblivious to everything but their growth.</p>
          <p>All. All this, All so foreign. All cold and unaware.</p>
          <p>A universe of vast silences and expanding indifference.</p>
          <p>Cold, Cool, Beautiful.</p>

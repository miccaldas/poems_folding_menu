<p>“Seek and ye shall find.”</p>
<p>Says the Good Book.</p>
<p>Many were lost for heeding these words.</p>
<p>For if there are plenty of books,</p>
<p>Not one,</p>
<p>is Good.</p>
<p>But still they manage to get written,</p>
<p>engraving themselves in the hearts of men who bask by the fire of Words,</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>foolishly,</p>
<p>look for their reflection in the World.</p>
<p>These are the starry eyed dreamers,</p>
<p>The heroes,</p>
<p>The revolutionaries…</p>
<p>drowning in contemplation of the Palace of Reason that exists only in the soul…</p>
<p>not the ever decaying chaos of becoming.</p>
<p>They’re blinded by truth,</p>
<p>drunk on certainty,</p>
<p>choking on Reality,</p>
<p>and gagging in Light…</p>
<p>They look to the world in hope..</p>
<p>waiting for it to turn out as they know it should.</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>Seeing it carrying on indifferent and unaware of their plans.</p>
<p>They take on themselves the burden of change.</p>
<p>And so they walk;</p>
<p>The path of the good man,</p>
<p>The path of the righteous and the pious…</p>
<p>Of the northern man,</p>
<p>cowering under dreams of land and bloodlines…</p>
<p>The path of the Cow.</p>
<p>Oblivious to everything but of the small pasture his herd calls home,</p>
<p>Wanting for nothing and thinking about less.</p>
<p>And as they gather to celebrate their bovine ethos of exclusion, we hear their rambling ruminations on family,</p>
<p>land,</p>
<p>purity.</p>
<p>Celebrating closeness and sameness,</p>
<p>Making of their hearth their world.</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>As we avert our eyes from this cozy landlocked scene,</p>
<p>and turn to the vast sea that faces us, each an every day,</p>
<p>We cannot help but think that,</p>
<p>Not for us the clear trek,</p>
<p>Not for us the known path…</p>
<p>We’re of the Midday,</p>
<p>We’re made of hard truths and harder lies…</p>
<p>Here,</p>
<p>baking beneath the inflexible sun,</p>
<p>lingers a race of dark men,</p>
<p>Who live under the terrible burden of the naked truth.</p>
<p>No wolf gods, no mists no trees, no rivers, no fountains no nothing!</p>
<p>But the unavoidable burden of living alone before the Great Power.</p>
<p>Distant, cold and aloof,</p>
<p>A God not for the man who needs prayers, sacrifices, dances, parties, feasts, drugs…</p>
<p>All the paraphernalia that lesser man use to cloud the unknowing.</p>
<p>Here</p>
<p>Beneath the high blue skies and the rampant violence of the sun,</p>
<p>Loiter those for whom God is so present that it hurts.</p>
<p>A belief so deep that is not a belief anymore,</p>
<p>But life devoid of pleasure and contentment.</p>
<p>Empty of everything but His intrusive existence.</p>

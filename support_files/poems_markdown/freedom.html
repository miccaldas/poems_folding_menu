<p>Have they taught you nothing?</p>
<p>All the prophets,</p>
<p>all the poets,</p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>Thousands of years of words, deeds and actions,</p>
<p>Have you not heard?</p>
<p>Saw?</p>
<p>Understood?</p>
<p>No matter</p>
<p>For what I’ve come to tell you is the summation of everything that was told before me.</p>
<p>At least everything true.</p>
<p>All truths, all science, all art, all philosophy,</p>
<p>All paths to freedom through knowledge,</p>
<p>come to this:</p>
<p>It’s not important.</p>
<p>You are not important,</p>
<p>Your family is not important,</p>
<p>Your friends are meaningless,</p>
<p>Society does not exist,</p>
<p>There is no “we”,</p>
<p>Bury the fiction of Nation,</p>
<p>Of good deeds and bad,</p>
<p>Of knowledge,</p>
<p>Of beauty,</p>
<p>Of love</p>
<p>All of this is wrong, small and unimportant.</p>
<p>And it was this that they were telling you,</p>
<p>The prophets and poets and the others.</p>
<p>It was just this, they wanted you to know.</p>
<p>This is all you needed to know.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice!</p>
<p>For now you are free!</p>
<p>Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice!</p>
<p>For now you live in a brighter, better world!</p>
<p>All life, all of it,</p>
<p>in its complexity and abstruse variance,</p>
<p>is of no importance.</p>
<p>All has no meaning in this bigger picture will make our own,</p>
<p>For if it’s the result of evolving matter as say the scientists, what of it?</p>
<p>Theirs is but a small place in the universe,</p>
<p>Beautiful,</p>
<p>But small, and of no consequence.</p>
<p>And if life is the gift from Gods, is this the bigger boon we can imagine?</p>
<p>Surely not.</p>
<p>So rejoice, rejoice!</p>
<p>You were set free from respect to life!</p>
<p>And what about friends and family,</p>
<p>And all the bonds of empathy that keep us together?</p>
<p>What of them?</p>
<p>Since Life failed us as an answer,</p>
<p>we could always take refuge on the certainty of love.</p>
<p>But we all know,</p>
<p>deep down,</p>
<p>that this is not sure footing for the lovers of truth.</p>
<p>This is a marshy land, that shifts and moves ceaselessly.</p>
<p>Very beautiful and not to be trusted.</p>
<p>The answer is not love,</p>
<p>Nor is it all you need,</p>
<p>Because we need so much more.</p>
<p>Rejoice, Rejoice!</p>
<p>For the Ghost of love no longer haunts you!</p>
<p>And the knowledge of all these things,</p>
<p>Brought together by reason, logic and intuition,</p>
<p>Is of no consequence even before its very eyes.</p>
<p>For its science itself that teaches us that what we know is but a speck in what there is to discover.</p>
<p>And that what we can imagine is like a haze covering what might be there.</p>
<p>When you look at a stone,</p>
<p>any stone,</p>
<p>And imagine the millennia it witnessed:</p>
<p>Being on the bed of a lost sea,</p>
<p>Having risen to heights of mountains that disappeared,</p>
<p>watching dead animals howling at stars that</p>
<p>for so long</p>
<p>have changed their place in the skies…</p>
<p>To now be carried unaware in your hand,</p>
<p>with no inkling of itself,</p>
<p>deaf, dumb and blind.</p>
<p>This in each and every rock!</p>
<p>Rejoice!</p>
<p>The burden of knowing was lifted from your shoulders!</p>
<p>And God in all this? Where to find him?</p>
<p>Everywhere.</p>
<p>For this is a poem not about the death of God but of its awakening.</p>
<p>Not the God of the spiritual accountants they keep chained in Churches,</p>
<p>Any church,</p>
<p>Not the personal God who has hygiene advice’s for you,</p>
<p>Your wife,</p>
<p>Your dog.</p>
<p>Not the God of everlasting love and goodness that sounds so human that we call him Father,</p>
<p>sometimes,</p>
<p>Mother,</p>
<p>More often,</p>
<p>creating sacred families of variable geometries,</p>
<p>and unfailing dysfunctionalitiy.</p>
<p>God is so,</p>
<p>so,</p>
<p>distant.</p>
<p>Beyond the last frontier of imagination.</p>
<p>Making sure by its presence that our wildest dreams are nothing but small extensions of ourselves,</p>
<p>Not the yardstick with which to measure the Universe.</p>
<p>r&gt; So rejoice!</p>
<p>For God is far way! r&gt; Haven’t you learned nothing?</p>
<p>From all the Poets, Philosophers and Prophets of the ages?</p>
<p>To think far and wide and deep,</p>
<p>so you can see how near and small and shallow you are?</p>
<p>r&gt; This was all the knowledge you needed to live free from fear.</p>
<p>And even this,</p>
<p>Is not important.</p>

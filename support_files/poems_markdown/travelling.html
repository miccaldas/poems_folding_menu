<p>All people have a geography.</p>
<p>Even if beggared from anything else,</p>
<p>they exist in space,</p>
<p>and their pattern in it</p>
<p>is wholly their own.</p>
<p>We all have a topology,</p>
<p>although there might be nothing to distinguish us,</p>
<p>although we may be silent in history,</p>
<p>our paths exist,</p>
<p>despite being known only to ourselves,</p>
<p>Today I make this pronouncement</p>
<p>That all paths of men are to be studied.</p>
<p>That all geographies are important,</p>
<p>and I suggest here,</p>
<p>for the very first time.</p>
<p>the hypothetical existence</p>
<p>Never seen because never studied</p>
<p>Of a man’s trek that,</p>
<p>If absent of history,</p>
<p>exults in topography.</p>
<p>Routines made of subways, trains and trams crossing lines in the skin of the city,</p>
<p>mandalas built of boozy nights spent bar hopping,</p>
<p>sigils born from trips to the drugstore in the corner,</p>
<p>and cosmogonies explained by holidays at the beach.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Yesterday I dreamt of a girl I loved at eleven.</p>
<p>And in the dream I saw her, now.</p>
<p>Older, thinner … a little gaunt,</p>
<p>But still beautiful.</p>
<p>Immense brown eyes</p>
<p>attentive,</p>
<p>restless,</p>
<p>and tense.</p>
<p>And I,</p>
<p>I loved her with the intensity of a eleven year old.</p>
<p>I was elated by this gift of feeling love like the first,</p>
<p>for a second time.</p>
<p>I found her in a small town</p>
<p>In the dream</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>After she disappeared saying very little,</p>
<p>I knew that that was where I would live forever.</p>
<p>Then I dreamt about her friends,</p>
<p>the town,</p>
<p>and how to stay there.</p>
<p>In the dream they asked me if I,</p>
<p>really,</p>
<p>wanted to stay in the town.</p>
<p>Which was</p>
<p>In fact</p>
<p>So small.</p>
<p>And I said</p>
<p>“Yes.</p>
<p>She’s the love of my life.”</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>There’s a concept called “path dependence”, that says that your current decisions are determined by earlier ones.</p>
<p>That all that happens results from what you did, no matter how remote,</p>
<p>and that the past is the solution to the present.</p>
<p>In this world there are no master plans,</p>
<p>no strategic visions,</p>
<p>guiding lines,</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>In this way of seeing, all that there is, is, because of previous actions.</p>
<p>No other truth but the path,</p>
<p>steps taken,</p>
<p>nothing else.</p>
<p>In this vision the route is all.</p>
<p>It’s the cause and the explanation,</p>
<p>the need and the answer.</p>
<p>And maybe it’s for this that all geographies are important.</p>
<p>Because there’s no teleonomy</p>
<p>teleology,</p>
<p>eschatology,</p>
<p>to illuminate the path that is us.</p>
<p>And here we stand,</p>
<p>In our own timelines</p>
<p>frail and complete,</p>
<p>Only in them, ontology</p>
<p>Only in them, aesthetics,</p>
<p>Only in them, the hope of redemption.</p>
<p>And for all this,</p>
<p>And because of this,</p>
<p>a man,</p>
<p>at 44,</p>
<p>can dream about the beginning of his life,</p>
<p>and wake up the next morning,</p>
<p>happy,</p>
<p>with a heart full of songs.</p>

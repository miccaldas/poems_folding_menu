<p>“When your stepfather was dying in the hospital”</p>
<p>Said my mother</p>
<p>He would look at me and say:</p>
<p>“Save me! Save me!”</p>
<p>And I thought he was talking about the medication that caused him pain”</p>
<p>She took a sip from her glass and continued.</p>
<p>“But of course I was lying to myself.</p>
<p>He wasn’t talking about the medication…</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>Yeah…</p>
<p>Not everyone dies well.”</p>

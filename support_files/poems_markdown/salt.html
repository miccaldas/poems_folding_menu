<p>I’m becoming the pillar of salt.<br />
The last glance to Gomorrah.</p>
<p>Orpheus guilty glimpse over the shoulder,<br />
the last long look to things not done,<br />
to the Styx and<br />
forward.<br />
Forward…<br />
to the sadness of wrong turns taken at the wrong times.</p>
<p>Opportunities lost as soon as they are found,<br />
time passing by like a thief in the night…</p>
<p>watching the spectacle of being and<br />
living as the silent detached witness of myself.</p>
<p>Cold<br />
distant<br />
and aloof.</p>
<p>I haven’t slept for five years.</p>
<p>All,</p>
<p>All days<br />
mornings afternoons and nights,</p>
<p>all,<br />
together,<br />
one after the other.<br />
All days and all nights,<br />
are the same, under the harsh insomniac light.</p>
<p>The hours pass<br />
(dirge-like as in a prison)<br />
as I walk down the garden locked inside the walls of my house.</p>
<p>The light darts yellow trough the window and onto the trees,<br />
as if shielding them from reality…</p>
<p>Yellow restless light that counts time passed between vigil and feverish dreams.<br />
A light of ruse and mischief,<br />
artistry and puppetry,<br />
light made by a slight of hands, smoke and mirrors.<br />
reminding me that,<br />
from now on,<br />
there is nothing here but the ghosts of reason.</p>
<p>In the phantasmal light that scars the trees,<br />
I sit grass like and canopy looking…<br />
tall and distant….<br />
Taut and alert.</p>
<p>trees.</p>
<p>I watch them green and stupid,<br />
tended and erect,<br />
darting upwards towards the sky…</p>
<p>silently intent on photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Inside them a myriad of organisms, moved by the simplest tropisms.<br />
grow and move,<br />
restlessly and mercilessly,<br />
unmoving and uncaring.<br />
oblivious to everything but their growth.</p>
<p>All. All this, All so foreign. All cold and unaware.</p>
<p>A universe of vast silences and expanding indifference.</p>
<p>Cold, Cool, Beautiful.</p>

<p>The ratattat of the perforations on the silvery blister,</p>
<p>orphans the pills in the sheet,</p>
<p>tiny little jewels of sleep and forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Bent and cracked,</p>
<p>sometimes left,</p>
<p>sometimes right.</p>
<p>the casings crushed downwards and peeling</p>
<p>the silvery film that tells that it’s the rohypnol,</p>
<p>that’ll get you to the end of anxiety.</p>
<p>As it gets uglier, scrunched up and asymmetrical,</p>
<p>someone</p>
<p>somewhere,</p>
<p>is feeling prettier.</p>

<p>The girl stood in front of the car screaming:</p>
<p>“No!</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>No!”</p>
<p>There was a thud,</p>
<p>and then nothing.</p>
<p>Her friend stared</p>
<p>as she shouted at the driver:</p>
<p>“Real nice M’am! Really, really nice!”</p>
<p>I looked behind me, to the cat in the road.</p>
<p>It was jumping and somersaulting spasmodically</p>
<p>In total silence</p>
<p>pirouetting in the air,</p>
<p>almost never touching the tarmac,</p>
<p>an acrobat of pain.</p>
<p>Not what you’d expect from a cat ran over.</p>
<p>But there he was,</p>
<p>airborne</p>
<p>contorted</p>
<p>kinetic</p>
<p>hurt.</p>
<p>Coiling and uncoiling at lunchtime.</p>

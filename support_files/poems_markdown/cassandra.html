<p>These are the days of new beginnings,</p>
<p>and longing for the ones that are not our own anymore,</p>
<p>and wont be missed.</p>
<p>These are the days of change and reinvention,</p>
<p>Of dead structure withering as dead leaves,</p>
<p>Of looking ahead to nothing known,</p>
<p>And living in the maelstrom of becoming.</p>
<p>Where we are just movement,</p>
<p>change,</p>
<p>and oblivion.</p>
<p>Some call it decay,</p>
<p>Others birthing.</p>
<p>We call it pain and confusion.</p>
<p>We call it, our lives.</p>
<p>These are the days of siren calls</p>
<p>Wailing their last warnings to deaf ears.</p>
<p>Everywhere we hear the Cassandra warning us about the demise of a life</p>
<p>That is already lost.</p>
<p>The death of the West,</p>
<p>Proclaimed for so long,</p>
<p>Is now an inexorable fact.</p>
<p>There are no ruins,</p>
<p>And there are no more men.</p>
<p>All the dreams are dead.</p>
<p>Sadder eyes and clearer heads are needed to live this becoming that engulfed us.</p>
<p>The past is no more a beacon,</p>
<p>As the future we’ve foreseen is no more there.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The plans of mice of men…</p>
<p>Are not plans but tropisms,</p>
<p>As men and mice are not agents but matter.</p>
<p>Nothing to do now but to contemplate the mill of history,</p>
<p>Grinding away at today</p>
<p>Replacing it with a future that will frighten us all,</p>
<p>the Changing of the Guard generation,</p>
<p>or won’t be any kind of future.</p>

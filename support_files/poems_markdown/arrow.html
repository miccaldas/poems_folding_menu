<p>In front. Always in front. Ahead. In your face. Always in your face. Before you.</p>
<p>Hours await.</p>
<p>The long procession of minutes (armed to the teeth with seconds). They wait at the corner of now To become the ever expanding procession of days.</p>
<p>An infinite throng of instants peruses menacingly, as I finish a cigarette and look trough the cafe window.</p>
<p>And, Then, When you’re not expecting,</p>
<p>The Hordes of time storm the tower, to enforce the grim yoke of Boredom.</p>
<p>You light another cigarette, and hope it’ll pass.</p>
<p>But it won’t.</p>
<p>You were conquered by the army most ferocious.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Thunderous cavalcades of infinity, Roaring armies of permanence Ready and waiting to rip you to shreds and serve you to Uncountable multitudes of moments, followed by more ravenous moments…</p>
<p>Pulling in… Pulling to…. To…</p>
<p>Immeasurable quantities of instants, Armed and belligerent… Screaming for the bloody murder of you.</p>
<p>Time’s arrow is taut and awaits release. Its vicious murderous desire for oblivion will not be abated. …</p>
<p>Time’s arrow is taut and you are the target.</p>
<p>There’s nothing left to do …</p>
<p>All your efforts … all for naught.</p>
<p>Nothing to do … But grit your teeth, And brace for impact.</p>

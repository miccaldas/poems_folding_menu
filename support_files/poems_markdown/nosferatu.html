<p>Stained clouds by the oily sludge of the night</p>
<p>mar the skyline who looms over the alley and dinner,</p>
<p>Twitching, squirming,</p>
<p>Bloody and delicious.</p>
<p>I watched as it moved one last time.</p>
<p>The moon cowered beneath the smog,</p>
<p>Neon sprayed light trough the dark recesses of the city…</p>
<p>Low, dwindling stars, illuminate a mankind that deserves no other light.</p>
<p>I lean against the wall, breathless and sated,</p>
<p>Casting my eyes to on high,</p>
<p>Searching for a God that has forsaken me.</p>
<p>Leaving me alone with the billboards of banks and travel agencies,</p>
<p>Sneakers and massage parlours,</p>
<p>Shoe stores and chemists…</p>
<p>Brightly coloured hues of dreaming, irradiating over the street.</p>
<p>Full of the night lights and city sounds…</p>
<p>Resting and digesting,</p>
<p>as if the corpse before me was not my doing.</p>
<p>As if no one would,</p>
<p>ever,</p>
<p>Come here</p>
<p>As if I could rest …</p>
<p>for awhile.</p>
<p>The food stopped moving long ago.</p>
<p>An empty dish for a vacant meal.</p>
<p>The thrill of the hunt, the pleasure of the kill,</p>
<p>Feeding…</p>
<p>All so quick, so good and so sudden.</p>
<p>I get up and get ready to leave,</p>
<p>Button up my coat and leave this happy place of feeding.</p>
<p>Strangely nostalgic for this now that is ended.</p>
<p>The cold wind sharpens my pace as I look for the train station.</p>
<p>Hungry to be elsewhere.</p>
<p>Away from this geometric unwelcoming town.</p>
<p>Eager, so eager,</p>
<p>To get home.</p>
<p>Away from all the animals that roam these streets.</p>

<p>Will we weep for the loss of absent friends?</p>
<p>Will time leave us alone?</p>
<p>Will sloth and neglect, estrange us from the ones we love the most?</p>
<p>Will the mill of days grind away the ties that bound us?</p>
<p>No time like now,</p>
<p>No words but these words</p>
<p>No persons but these persons…</p>
<p>The ones here.</p>
<p>Not the chosen,</p>
<p>But the remaining.</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>I ask myself…</p>
<p>Will we forgive ourselves for our forgetfulness?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>All people</p>
<p>Everywhere</p>
<p>Everyday…</p>
<p>The enormous throng of people we knew and loved…</p>
<p>Taken by time and sacrificed in the altar of now.</p>
<p>Distant shadows of a past made unnecessary.</p>
<p>Not by you.</p>
<p>Not by the others.</p>
<p>But by now,</p>
<p>By the movement.</p>
<p>This place in this time, and this place in this</p>
<p>place.</p>
<p>Love trampled under the wheels of necessity</p>
<p>and the stupid fascism of need.</p>
<p>And to all this I ask:</p>
<p>Will we miss our friends forgotten?</p>
<p>Will we need their love and warmth?</p>
<p>Will we be lonely?</p>
<p>Afraid of being adrift with ourselves?</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Time passes like a glacier trough a valley,</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, all will collapse under the weight of the frost.</p>
<p>Like the valley,</p>
<p>We’ll be striped of everything,</p>
<p>Naked and alone.</p>
<p>And here, in presence of our own structure,</p>
<p>Before the great truth…</p>
<p>We cowardly long for time we spent with others and the truths we shared…</p>
<p>Longing for all the things we left behind…</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>Knowing this…</p>
<p>Will we weep for the loss of absent friends?</p>

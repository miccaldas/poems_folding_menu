<p>I ran into the heart of winter,</p>
<p>Deep, Deep into the naked trees,</p>
<p>into the blistering wind.</p>
<p>In search of the cleansing rain I went.</p>
<p>I rushed into the snow.</p>
<p>Into the snow icy core I plunged.</p>
<p>Inside the frozen plain.</p>
<p>Into the throbbing Soul I moved…</p>
<p>The Ice respired death all around…</p>
<p>Stopping the world,</p>
<p>The winter,</p>
<p>The cold,</p>
<p>Thought.</p>
<p>Even me.</p>
<p>And, here,</p>
<p>In the shivering cold,</p>
<p>I sit down and,</p>
<p>For the first time I,</p>
<p>close my eyes</p>
<p>to never open them again</p>
<p>And, then…</p>
<p>As expected.</p>
<p>As wanted;</p>
<p>as needed.</p>
<p>Came the ominous heat</p>
<p>I’ve known for so long.</p>
<p>The warm nothingness that was here from the start.</p>
<p>In the beginning of days;</p>
<p>My days.</p>
<p>A life-time of blind love to a hidden God…</p>
<p>Only seen through the dim glass of the Black Light</p>
<p>Shining in me and through me…</p>
<p>Like an unspeakable silence that can not be understood.</p>
<p>Only embraced.</p>
<p>And, as I sat here,</p>
<p>To never rise again.</p>
<p>I wait most intently.</p>
<p>Not waiting for anything…</p>
<p>being wait in itself.</p>
<p>Available for all;</p>
<p>latent.</p>
<p>Frozen to the world and burning for the hand of God.</p>
<p>And the inky waters of Being start to move…</p>
<p>slowly.</p>
<p>Very slowly,</p>
<p>deep,</p>
<p>deep,</p>
<p>down there…</p>
<p>inside,</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>Like a tectonic revolution.</p>
<p>Rumbling upwards,</p>
<p>crushing everything in its path.</p>
<p>To</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>as I wait,</p>
<p>as I stop,</p>
<p>to never move again.</p>
<p>I pray to the God I don’t believe anymore.</p>
<p>To give me the strength,</p>
<p>and the fortitude.</p>
<p>to see the all consuming beauty,</p>
<p>Of the Black Light.</p>

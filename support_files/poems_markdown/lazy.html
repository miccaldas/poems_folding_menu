<p>Lazy afternoons,</p>
<p>all made of sunshine and permanence,</p>
<p>light and duration;</p>
<p>could they last forever…</p>
<p>Listless Sun soaked hours,</p>
<p>filled to the brim with nothing</p>
<p>and hollowed of any promise but its own shiny pointlessness.</p>
<p>These are the times that are,</p>
<p>truly,</p>
<p>ours.</p>
<p>This is our allotted time,</p>
<p>all else is purposeful living.</p>
<p>Years, months and days dedicated to the pursuits that we esteem as worthy:</p>
<p>career,</p>
<p>money,</p>
<p>the respect of our peers,</p>
<p>more money</p>
<p>ourselves,</p>
<p>family,</p>
<p>the masses,</p>
<p>God,</p>
<p>the whales.</p>
<p>All these and more</p>
<p>much more,</p>
<p>occupies us inside and out,</p>
<p>as we dedicate large chunks of our lives to their conquest.</p>
<p>Noble and important as they may be,</p>
<p>(they’re not)</p>
<p>they are not truly ours.</p>
<p>Their place is the no man’s land that separates what they want from you,</p>
<p>from what you want from them.</p>
<p>Its in this field of glory that you’ll forget yourself, to win them,</p>
<p>and where they’ll accommodate you, for no greater good.</p>
<p>Everybody gives a little,</p>
<p>nobody wins.</p>
<p>This is the base of the new social contract,</p>
<p>a fierce and egalitarian force preventing anyone from getting what they want.</p>
<p>Social justice making sure that everyone gets fucked the same</p>
<p>and in the same way.</p>
<p>A socialization of misery,</p>
<p>if you will.</p>
<p>But not today.</p>
<p>at least not this afternoon.</p>
<p>Today there’s nothing to do but be,</p>
<p>here.</p>
<p>Useless,</p>
<p>and with nowhere to go.</p>

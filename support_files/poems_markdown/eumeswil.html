<p>When I close my eyes I see a desert.</p>
<p>The, long, brown, infinity that stretches from the mountains to the sea.</p>
<p>Leaving everything in between dead, and indifferent to its embrace.</p>
<p>A space of immobility where movement is Wind.</p>
<p>Blowing.</p>
<p>Hard and soft….</p>
<p>Subtle and strong…</p>
<p>Northward and southward,</p>
<p>Hither and thither.</p>
<p>Striping the structure out of the desert.</p>
<p>The only truth the wind.</p>
<p>And the wind is the desert.</p>
<p>And the desert is …</p>
<p>It.</p>
<p>The desert as the end of wanting.</p>
<p>The last mile of hope in the road to despair.</p>
<p>Where the Saviour goes to die.</p>
<p>This is the place were everything stops, and is moved by chance.</p>
<p>The place of the prime movement</p>
<p>Fate,</p>
<p>Chance,</p>
<p>Flow.</p>
<p>When I close my eyes I see a desert,</p>
<p>Beneath me, and in front of me.</p>
<p>In space in now, in time in here.</p>
<p>Southward on the other side of the sea,</p>
<p>in the other side of the ocean.</p>
<p>Europa’s birthplace.</p>
<p>My birthplace.</p>
<p>The desert that was then when we started.</p>
<p>When Europa made its first tentative steps to Itself.</p>
<p>A desert not as a desert but as a barren place;</p>
<p>A place where to be free.</p>
<p>In the Future,</p>
<p>Here,</p>
<p>In Europa,</p>
<p>The Peninsula will be a undulating vastness of naught.</p>
<p>Rocks and sand where once stood the cities of today,</p>
<p>Ruins of fountains, pools and waters mirrors,</p>
<p>Incomprehensible artifacts of a past best forgotten.</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>Scurrying nimbly through the desert,</p>
<p>Our children’s children.</p>
<p>Trapped in a culture too slow to move with time.</p>
<p>Still believing themselves Empire,</p>
<p>but,</p>
<p>now,</p>
<p>all made of sand.</p>
<p>Yesterday,</p>
<p>Late in the day,</p>
<p>Yesterday,</p>
<p>Long ago,</p>
<p>In a day dead and done,</p>
<p>The day before now,</p>
<p>Yesterday.</p>
<p>It’s hours frozen by time,</p>
<p>For it’s yesterday.</p>
<p>Final and frail as porcelain dolls.</p>
<p>These are the days that you’re given.</p>
<p>Existing because time is locked in yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday where knowledge goes to die.</p>
<p>A land of reason and language,</p>
<p>The last sarcophagi of living and a prison.</p>
<p>It’s in this tomb of being that I see the desert,</p>
<p>Southward and in the desert.</p>
<p>A premonition of nothing,</p>
<p>A call to arms</p>
<p>And words to the wise</p>
<p>The sky seems to get a little bit higher,</p>
<p>Going upwards and upwards,</p>
<p>Escaping us in a hurry.</p>
<p>Fleeing a place promised to anathema.</p>
<p>Knowing something we don’t.</p>
<p>The rain is evermore scarce,</p>
<p>The forests crackle dry and burn in winter.</p>
<p>The rivers turn into torrents of mud.</p>
<p>Crocodiles hunt in the mountains</p>
<p>And bears fish by the sea shore.</p>
<p>The climate is changing and we seem to stand still.</p>
<p>As the oceans flood the lands</p>
<p>And the desert gobbles up forests.</p>
<p>Rain now only a wet remembrance of days gone by</p>
<p>An enormous sadness for the watery world we left behind,</p>
<p>Fills the air under a indifferent sky.</p>
<p>Growing evermore remote.</p>
<p>Scientists say it’s not going to rain anymore.</p>
<p>That we shouldn’t count on our crops,</p>
<p>Anymore.</p>
<p>Rain buried in the dust that becomes wind,</p>
<p>Flying through the ocean to the,</p>
<p>Original desert.</p>
<p>Sand as the seed of the future.</p>
<p>Feeding on each other,</p>
<p>And turning the Mediterranean a salty oasis.</p>
<p>Scientists say our land is dying and that we should move away,</p>
<p>Elsewhere,</p>
<p>Anywhere,</p>
<p>To a land that’ll keep us…</p>
<p>But I … I’m not a scientist,</p>
<p>So I’ll think I stay.</p>
<p>And as I prepare to wait I ask myself,</p>
<p>Will the desert bring its own religion</p>
<p>Will this be the final death of the Green Man ?</p>
<p>The Green Man survived the cross,</p>
<p>Will he survive the death of the woods?</p>
<p>Will the sand bring forth Mohamed or will this be Christ greatest triumph?</p>
<p>He is,</p>
<p>After all</p>
<p>A son of the desert,</p>
<p>Or,</p>
<p>Maybe,</p>
<p>In the end,</p>
<p>This will be the final moment in a 2000 year old changing of the guard.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mohamed and Christ are not all that different,</p>
<p>Both are sons of the desert and grew feeding on the spirits of the wind,</p>
<p>The tree spirits mortal enemies.</p>
<p>Or maybe something new will appear,</p>
<p>A culling of all this deities, places and times.</p>
<p>A crucible to bring forth a new and happy science,</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>This is not a place of beginnings but of endings.</p>
<p>A place best understood by the old at heart,</p>
<p>The cautious and suspicious mood of age best suits this changing mores.</p>
<p>And the old,</p>
<p>Out of habit and out of fear,</p>
<p>Look to the past for answers.</p>
<p>To yesterday,</p>
<p>To the house of porcelain dolls of intelligence and discourse.</p>
<p>But not even time past can illuminate the somber path that lies ahead.</p>
<p>Only looking long into the past,</p>
<p>Can we glimmer faintly to something akin.</p>
<p>Deep into the harbour of the first wanting,</p>
<p>can we find the face that suits these final features.</p>
<p>Europa’s long journey from the bogs of magic though the plains of philosophy and to the rarefied mountains of science</p>
<p>has brought to a place so bereft of everything else,</p>
<p>That only the first Gods</p>
<p>Who were not here and needed nothing,</p>
<p>Can exist</p>
<p>Finally liberated from the shackles of religion,</p>
<p>The bonds of reason</p>
<p>The yoke of aesthetics</p>
<p>The burden of morality</p>
<p>We were delivered free</p>
<p>To the desert of our own creation.</p>
<p>And as form follow function</p>
<p>And matter follows spirit,</p>
<p>Our land becomes as inhabitable as our heads.</p>
<p>When I close my eyes I see a desert.</p>
<p>I move from the window where I stood,</p>
<p>And stagger into my darkened bedroom,</p>
<p>And lying on my bed,</p>
<p>Eyes wide,</p>
<p>Looking intently into the ceiling</p>
<p>I shed the first tears for the place where I’ll live, Waiting its coming, Their people.</p>
